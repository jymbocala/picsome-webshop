## Description
Picsome Shop is a mock online shop using React. I used my knowledge from Scrimba's Advanced React course to create a dynamic and engaging experience for users. 

The app features a home page where users can browse and favorite products, and a cart page where they can manage the items they've added to their cart. I designed the app to be highly interactive and responsive, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the various features. The end result is a seamless shopping experience that provides value to the users.
